This document is a reference of useful git commands. I will add more as I need them.

## Git Branch

It is common to create a new branch for each new feature, or bug fix. This allows all the code related to fixed that specific bug, or adding that feature to be easily viewed.

To create a new branch called 'branch-name':

```Shell
git branch 'branch-name'
```

note: the quotes are not required

To display the list of current branches (your current branch will be highlighted by an \*):

```Shell
git branch
```

To switch to a different branch:

```Shell
git checkout 'other-branch'
```

## Merge branches

To merge a branch into your current branch, first make sure you are on the branch you want the changes to be merge into. e.g if you have two branches named 'master' and 'branch-name' and want to merge the changes made in 'branch-name' into the master branch you would want to verify that you are currently in the master branch.

Note that any local commits will need to be synced before git will allow a merge between branches. If you have any merge conflicts they will need to be resolved before you can commit the newly merged branch.

```Shell
git merge 'branch-name'
```

## Going to documentation page for a specific git commands

You can quickly open a browser page the the docs page for any individual git command by adding the --help flag to the end of it.

```Shell
git branch --help
```
