MDX is markdown with support for JSX. It is a super flexible language that allows you the terseness of markdown and the advanced functionality of React components.

There is a good instructions on the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/)
[Gatsby plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/)

- download mdx plugin for vscode. I used [MDX](https://github.com/silvenon/vscode-mdx)

- add to VScode settings

```JSON
"files.associations": {
     "*.md": "mdx"
   },
```
