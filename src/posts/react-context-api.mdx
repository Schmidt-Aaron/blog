React [context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) is a way to share data between a parent component and any child component, no matter how many levels down the tree the child is.

Before context you had two options for this type of deep sharing. You could use a state management tool like Redux to keep your data in a separate state container, and use that store as the primary source of truth. Alternatively, you could pass down the data from the parent component through all of the levels of the application to the desired child component using a technique known as prop-drilling.

Both techniques can be quite tedious and involve lots of boilerplate (I'm looking at you Redux).

Enter Context.

Context is way to create a global data store that can be accessed by any of the child components beneath the section of the tree it is inserted in. It's ideal use-case is to store data that needs to be used by many different component at different levels. One ideal scenario is storing user data.

## Using Context to Store 'Global State'

Example without context.

```jsx
// sample user object
const user = {
  name: "Aaron",
  favoriteFood: "steak salad",
}

const App = () => {
  return <Profile user={user} />
}

const Profile = props => {
  const { name, favoriteFood } = props.user

  return (
    <>
      <Name name={name} />
      <Food food={favoriteFood} />
    </>
  )
}

const Name = props => <h1>Hi, my name is {props.name}!</h1>

const Food = props => <p>My favorite food is {props.food}!</p>
```

As you can see above we are manually passing down the props from our app component into a profile component that, in turn, passes it down into the name and food components This practice of called prop-drilling. For such a simple example prop-drilling is easy, but this pattern can become cumbersome as the application grows in complexity. Let's look at the same example using context to store and pass on our user data.

First we need to create the context object that will serve as our data store. Context should generally only store one thing (object, array, string, ..etc) because whenever one item in context is changed it will trigger a re-render and this could have negative performance implications.

```jsx
// sample user object
const user = {
  name: "Aaron",
  favoriteFood: "steak salad",
}

// create our context object
const userContext = React.createContext(null)
```

Then we will wrap our Profile component in a context.Provider. This will enable all the child components of this tree to access the context object.

```jsx
// wrap our profile
const App = () => {
  return (
    <userContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Profile />
    </userContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Now we can rewrite our child components to take advantage of the power of React context. First we will strip out our props in the intermediate Profile component. They are no longer needed. Yay!

## Consuming Context

Then we will access, or 'consume' our context. I have demonstrated two different methods of doing this. The Name component takes advantage of the useContext hook to bring in the context data into a new variable that we can then access inside the component. The Food component uses the context.Consumer pattern.

Both are viable ways to access your context, but I prefer the brevity and clarity of the useContext method.

```jsx
// skip intermediate component
const Profile = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Name />
      <Food />
    </>
  )
}

// access context via useContext hook
const Name = () => {
  const user = React.useContext(userContext)

  return <h1>Hi, my name is {user.name}!</h1>
}

// access context via consumer
const Food = () => {
  return (
    <userContext.Consumer>
      {value => <p>My favorite food is {value.favoriteFood}!</p>}
    </userContext.Consumer>
  )
}
```

Both of the above methods utilize functional components. If you are using a class-based component you can also access your context by using the pattern below.

```jsx
class Food extends React.Component {
  static contextType = userContext
  render() {
    const { favoriteFood } = this.context
    return <p>My favorite food is {favoriteFood}!</p>
  }
}
```

## Using Multiple Contexts

It is possible to use many different context objects in your project. The context provider is a [higher-order-component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) (HOC). HOCs are functions that take a component and returns it transformed into a new component. This is a very common pattern in React land. Without going on too much of a tangent, this is what the context.provider is doing. We pass it a `({children})` object of all the components beneath it in the tree and it adds a context object to those children and then returns them.

This means we can use as many context providers throughout our application as we want. These can be stacked at the top level like the example below or strewn throughout the app component tree.

```jsx
// sample user object
const user = {
  name: "Aaron",
}

const favoriteFoods = ["steak salad", "tacos", "roasted veggies"]

// create our context objects
const userContext = React.createContext(null)
const foodContext = React.createContext(null)

// wrap our profile with both contexts
const App = () => {
  return (
    <userContext.Provider value={user}>
      <foodContext.Provider value={favoriteFoods}>
        <Profile />
      </foodContext.Provider>
    </userContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Following this example we would now have to 'consume' our context objects separately using one of the methods above.

## Updating Context

This section will demonstrate how we can update our context object. Any updates to the context will effect all downstream references made to that particular context object.

## Context Gotchas

Todo... add Gotchas

You've made it to the end! We learned the basics about the context API, how to store data in context, how to access the stored data, and how to update context. The examples above were kept simple to make it easier to make the content easier to digest. In real world applications, all of the different components and context objects would be stored in separate files for reuseability.

Cheers!
