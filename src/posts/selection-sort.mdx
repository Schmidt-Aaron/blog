Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts by repeatedly finding the minimum element of the unsorted array then placing that element at the beginning. Every loop the algorithm advances the array index so the lowest element will be added next to the previous lowest element. This repeats until the entire input is sorted.

Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the two nested loops. This is one of the slowest sorting algorithms and has little practical use.

## Step-By-Step Example

### First Pass

unsorted index = 0;
(2, 9, **1**, 4, 8) => (**1**,2, 9, 4, 8)
1 is the lowest so it is moved to the beginning of the unsorted index.

### Second Pass

unsorted index = 1;
(1, **2**, 9, 4, 8) => (1, **2**, 9, 4, 8)

### Third Pass

unsorted index = 2;
(1, 2, 9, **4**, 8) => (1, 2, **4**, 9, 8)
4 is the lowest so it is moved to the beginning of the unsorted index.

### Forth Pass

unsorted index = 3;
(1, 2, 4, 9, **8**) => (1, 2, 4, **8**, 9)
8 is the lowest so it is moved to the beginning of the unsorted index.

### Fifth Pass

unsorted index = 4;
(1, 2, 4, 8, **9**) => (1, 2, 4, 8, **9**)

## Implementation

```js
const startingArray = [2, 9, 1, 4, 8]

function selectionSort(arr) {
  let unsortedArr = [...arr]
  let sortedArr = []
  let arrSize = unsortedArr.length
  let n = 0

  // loop once for every item in the starting array
  while (n < arrSize) {
    let minimum = unsortedArr[0]
    let index

    // loop through unsorted array and find minimum
    for (let i = 0; i < arrSize; i++) {
      if (unsortedArr[i] < minimum) {
        minimum = unsortedArr[i]
        index = i
      }
    }

    // push minimum value to sorted array
    sortedArr.push(minimum)

    // remove minimum value from unsorted array
    unsortedArr.splice(index, 1)

    // advance the outer counter
    n++
  }

  return sortedArr
}

selectionSort(startingArray) // [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]
```

Selection sort is more efficient than bubble sort in that the number of swaps will never be more than 0(n), however it shares the same time complexity as bubble sort O(n^2) so it is too slow to use for anything practical.
