# Hi!

Welcome to my personal website (WIP). The site will act as a portfolio and blog. This site was built using Gatsby basic starter that is in the process of being customized. I am currently only serving up a basic landing page as I work on customizing the structure and features to suit my needs. The main site will be launched Feb 2020.

## Tech

- Built using Gatsby
- CSS is handled with Emotion CSS-in-JS library
- Supports MDX
- Hosted on Netlify
- CI from master branch
- Prettier + Eslint code formatting
- prism code highlighting
- and more...

TODO - implement updated structure and launch!
